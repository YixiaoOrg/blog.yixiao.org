I don't remember when my family started having a computer at home. It seems like we've had one since I can remember, but it couldn't connect to the internet (before 2010 maybe). Anyway, when I first started using it, I would use software from USB drives or CDs, such as literacy software and CDs from kindergarten English textbooks.

When I was a bit older (elementary school), I would use Thunder to download pirated movies and bring them to the countryside to watch during the Chinese New Year, like the Home Alone series.

Around third or fourth grade, I watched my mom use online banking to buy a few Rubik's Cubes on Taobao (they're still at home). We also bought an iPad 3, and I would play games like Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, and My Talking Tom.

When I graduated from elementary school (2015), I got my own mobile phone and a basic feature phone.

In the later years of elementary school and the first year of junior high, I played games on 4399.com and bought Q coins recharge cards to recharge games on 4399.com and various QQ memberships.

In the second and third year of junior high, I played CrossFire and a little bit of Honor of Kings.

In high school, I only played Honor of Kings, but I didn't really enjoy playing games.

In my second year of high school (2019), I took a computer qualification exam and learned FrontPage and IIS. Since then, I've been unstoppable when it comes to building websites, haha.

-   **February 18, 2020**: Purchased an Alibaba Cloud server in Hong Kong (1 core CPU, 1GB RAM, 24 yuan).
-   **February 18, 2020**: Used the Alibaba Cloud Hong Kong server to build my first website, www.jspyx.top (WordPress).
-   **February 1, 2021**: Domain name registration approved.

There are so many stories that came after, I'll have to slowly remember them. It's really interesting.
