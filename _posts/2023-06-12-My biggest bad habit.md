I have many bad habits, most of which do not have a significant impact on me. However, there is one bad habit that has led to failures and setbacks since high school.

I am overly timid, always considering the pros and cons, and afraid of failure and wasted efforts.

This bad habit intensified as I explored the outside world through bypassing internet restrictions. I would often say that this or that is useless, questioning what truly has value.

I have consumed too much pessimistic and negative content.

As a result, I find myself living each day unhappily, consumed by anxiety about the future.

Now, as I reflect, I realize that I am still young. Why have I lost that drive? Why do I only have negative feelings about the future? I have already blocked many political accounts on Twitter and only focus on technical content. However, being someone who studies economics and sociology, it is difficult to find happiness in the state of the economy and society—unemployment, overwork, and intense competition.

Therefore, I have decided to start blocking terms like unemployment, layoffs, 996 (excessive work hours), and overwork from all my social media. I will also block all political terms. In politics, let it be as it is. I no longer want to discuss politics. The past is the past, and I don't care if the world will become a better place. I can only focus on improving myself for the sake of my family and team.

This year, I plan to launch an application on the App Store. Stay tuned for updates!
